# AI_code_draft

This is an initial attempt to code an AI to determine chemicals from the gathered data.

This code will upload the data, train AI based on the data set, and will tell the accuracy of the code.

## Artificial intelligence (AI) code.

Coded using google colab in Python.

## Code Testing Instructions.

1. Open Google Cloab. <br>
2. Upload the colab file. The extention should be ".ipynb". For Python, there is another file with extention ".py". <br>
3. Click to the "Files" from the left menu.<br>
4. Right click on the pane of the menu and upload the air data. The file extention is ".csv".<br>
5. Click the green "play/run" button on each line, starting from top to bottom, one by one.
