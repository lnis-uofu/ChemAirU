## Notes From The Material (PhD Student Thesis):

- Our method involves identifying the chemical
gases to which the sensors have been exposed by analyzing the distinct signature or fingerprint
formed through the combined responses of these sensors for each specific target
chemical. However, the nanofiber baseline drifts over time in controlled environment
(fixed temperature, humidity, air composition). For this reason, the sensor responses are
evaluated relative to the baseline and the signals require preprocessing before being evaluated.
