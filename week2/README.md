# Week2 Notes

## Notes From The Material (PhD Student Thesis):

- Air pollution problem is concern for human health
- Monitoring air quality in cities is a challenge
- Current available solutions: chemiresistive organic sensors particularly nanofiber-based technologies.
- Student designed and validated a wide range resistive sensor interface to monitor highly resistive (50 + GW) sensors such as nanofibers.

### Student Foundings:

- #1. Student introduced "a fully-integrated resistance-to-digital interface with on-board autonomous calibration 
and range selection to improve dynamic range and measurement error.
- #2. Student introduced "a low-power design to interface a high number of channels on a small die area of 5mm2".
- #3. Student demonstrated "the sampling frequency of relaxation oscillators is limited by parasitics from the sensors."
- #4. Student proposed "a parasitic mitigation circuitry to significantly improve the sampling frequency and also eliminate 
spurious commutations due to noise."

- Contribution of the thesis: a small form factor and low-cost system that can monitor 12 chemicals in parallel 
thanks to our new *resistance* *to* *digital* interface and emerging nanofiber sensors.

- commutations meaining: the act of putting one thing or person in the place of another; The reversal of the current direction 
in a motor every half cycle, which allows the motor to rotate
- spurious: false, fake
