# Matlab Code.

This folder contains Matlab code for the research. 
The code is aimed to analyze noise of the chemicals' responces and seperating 
each chemical's sensor respond into individual data sets.


## Purpose.

To be able to organize each chemical responce into their own data set to be able to analyize them individually .
Initally, all chemical responces will be saved/received in the same document/file. 

## Code Testing Instructions.

1. Open the "macro_chemAirU.xlsm" MS Excel file. <br>
2. Come to the "WorkHere" Worksheet from the below and go through the steps. <br>
3. Open the "chemAirU_v2.m" Matlab file. <br>
4. Come to the "EDITOR" tab on top. Click "Run". <br>
5. Come to the "EDITOR" tab on top. Click "Run" and check the resulted graphs. <br>
6. Optional: If you would like to analyze data closely zooming in a specifric range, <br>
please come to the "ENTER THE DESIRED ZOOM-IN RANGE" section on the same Matlab code page, <br> 
and enter your range. <br>

ZOOM-IN DATA TABLE ANALYSIS

### Progress Notes
<ins> Dec 3rd, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - Noise analysis draft is ready.

<ins> Nov 27, 2024 : </ins> <br>

 <ins> Nov 26, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - Sensor data plots are complete using Mathlab. 
 - Zoom-in Sensor data plots are complete using Mathlab.<br>
 
 
 <ins> Nov 20, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - All math work with the ".csv" files should be done using Mathlab. <br>
 
  <ins> Nov 19, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - Save as ".csv" excel macro code is added to the excel macro. <br>
 
 <ins> Nov 13, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - "zoom-in" data feature is added. The code and plots are ready. <br>
 
<ins>  Nov 7, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - Create the draft files for  noise analysis of the checmical data on Matlab. <br>

<ins>  Nov 6, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - Create the draft files for  checmical data analysis on Matlab, prepaire the logistics to start coding <br>
